            We have been doing business with StenTech for over 3 years and have never had a complaint. StenTech has always provided a quick and prompt on time delivery. The employees are always a pleasure to communicate with and their professionalism and quality-first mentality definitely carry over to their product.

            I would like to express what a great job StenTech in Austin has done for Silicon Hills Design over last few years. All stencils orders have been on time and some times I can get a stencil the same day. All the guys have performed detailed work and have been able to create paste layers when customers cannot provide them.

            StenTech has a history of quick turnaround and dependable quality. They have always been helpful with diligent and professional service on special requests such as rush orders, custom stencil framing, reframing, and special designs for glue printing or pin through paste applications.

            A+++ Excellence Service! Best overall service we have had when ordering any of StenTech product line over the past 5 years of dealing with them. Next day delivery on stencils, this is superior against other stencil houses I have ordered from.

            StenTech service and customer focus are unparalleled. Very fast turnarounds, even when rushed, and prices that are very competitive. Your ability to solve our cutting plate problems (CNC milling services) was impressive.
