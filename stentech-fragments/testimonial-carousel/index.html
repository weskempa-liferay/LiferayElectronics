          <p class="testimonial-text">I would like to express what a great job StenTech in Austin has done for Silicon Hills Design over last few years. All stencils orders have been on time and some times I can get a stencil the same day. All the guys have performed detailed work and have been able to create paste layers when customers cannot provide them.</p>
